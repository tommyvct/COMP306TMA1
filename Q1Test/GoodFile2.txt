DESCRIPTION
       zypper is a command-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp). It can be used to install, update,
       remove software, manage repositories, perform various queries, and more.

CONCEPTS
       Most of the following concepts are common for all applications based on the libzypp package management library,
       but there are some zypper specifics.

   System Packages
       The set of installed packages on a system is sometimes denoted as repository @System or System Packages. In
       contrast to available repositories providing packages which can be installed, @System provides packages which can
       only be deleted. Installed packages which are not also provided by at least one of the available repositories are
       often denoted as being unwanted, orphaned or dropped.

   Repositories
       Libzypp works with repository metadata, this is information about packages and their relations extracted from RPM
       packages and other data like patch information, pattern definitions, etc. These data are stored together with the
       RPM files in folders called repositories. Repositories can be placed on various media like an HTTP or FTP server,
       DVD, or a folder on a local disc.

       There is a special set of commands in zypper intended to manipulate repositories. Also many commands and options
       take a repository as an argument. See section COMMANDS, subsection Repository Management for more details.

   GPG checks
       Disabling GPG checks is not recommended. Signing data enables the recipient to verify that no modifications
       occurred after the data were signed. Accepting data with no, wrong or unknown signature can lead to a corrupted
       system and in extreme cases even to a system compromise.
